# Web Traffic Analysis

## Key Findings

### 1. Web Traffic Over Time
- Traffic counts vary significantly over time, with noticeable spikes during certain periods.
- This indicates periodic high-traffic events or anomalies that may correspond to specific times of the day or external factors.

### 2. Daily Web Traffic Trends
- Daily traffic patterns show sharp peaks and drops, reflecting variable user activity across days.
- Some days experience exceptionally high traffic, which could signify special events, promotions, or anomalies.

### 3. Rolling Mean Analysis
- The 24-hour rolling mean smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights underlying trends.
- Regular traffic peaks likely correspond to daily or weekly cycles, showcasing periodic behavior in user activity.

### 4. Autocorrelation Analysis
- Strong periodicity is evident, as seen in the autocorrelation plot.
- This confirms consistent traffic patterns, potentially driven by user habits, time zones, or scheduled events.

## Next Steps
- Perform time-series forecasting using models like Prophet to predict future traffic patterns.
- Investigate high-traffic anomalies to identify potential causes (e.g., marketing campaigns, outages).
- Explore periodic patterns further to optimize resource allocation during high-traffic times.
